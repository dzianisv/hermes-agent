"""Reclaim disk held by finished kanban cards: their git worktrees and the
sibling ``*-pi*.log`` / ``*-spec*.md`` scratch files left next to them.

Single Python implementation — the shell guard (``disk-guard.sh``) is expected
to call ``hermes kanban reclaim`` rather than keep its own copy.

The defect that caused the leak, pinned by tests:

Eligibility in the shell copy was ``git merge-base --is-ancestor <tip>
origin/main`` and nothing else. AgentPod squash-merges, so a merged branch's tip
is never an ancestor of main and NOTHING was ever eligible — measured on the
live host, all five worktrees died at that first gate and
``reclaim_merged_worktrees`` had removed 0 dirs over its entire log. A branch
whose local tip equals its remote ref has nothing unpushed and is safe to drop,
which is the arm added here.

:func:`path_in_use` enumerates processes in Python (never ``ps | grep``, which
can match its own argv) and excludes our own pid, so a path that does not exist
is not reported "in use". Note: this is hardening, NOT a fix for an observed
bug — the shell ``path_in_use`` was measured returning correct answers
(0/100 false positives, correct positive control), and an earlier claim that it
self-matched universally was a harness artifact and is retracted.

Every refusal carries a human-readable ``reason`` — a silent no-op is exactly
how the shell guard hid for months.
