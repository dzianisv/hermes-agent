# agentpod-stop-check

A runtime stop gate for **one opted-in supervisory session on one opted-in
project**: while the board still holds unattended unfinished work, the
supervision turn may not end.

Not installed by default. Opt-in via `config.yaml`, inert everywhere else.

## What actually enforces what

| Hook | Role | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| `pre_llm_call` (observer) | records this turn's **user message** | supervision context comes from the user, never from the model's own answer |
| `pre_verify` | **primary enforcement** — `{"action": "continue", "message": …, "final_verdict": …}` | the agent really keeps working the turn (it can call tools and act), bounded by `agent.max_verify_nudges` and a cross-process ledger; the same directive states the verdict the turn may not end without |
| core finalizer (`apply_pre_verify_verdict`) | **terminal enforcement** | the declared verdict is applied to the **delivered** answer *after* every `transform_llm_output` hook — so an earlier-sorting transform, a model that ignores the last instruction, or an exhausted budget can no longer produce a quiet ending |
| `transform_llm_output` | legacy fallback | on a runtime without the enforced-verdict contract, a still-quiet answer is **replaced** by a short blocker sized to the platform budget |

On turns that edited no files — which is what a supervision sweep usually is —
`pre_verify` only fires when the general core setting
`agent.pre_verify_on_no_edit_turns: true` is enabled (default `false`, shipped
behaviour unchanged for everyone else). That setting is not AgentPod-specific:
it is the supported way for any policy hook whose subject is not the diff to
continue a no-edit turn.

## Evidence rules

Attendance requires **observable, verifiable** evidence:

* **Verified external owner** — a row in the runtime process registry
  (`$HERMES_HOME/processes.json`) that is **structurally bound** to the card and
  whose identity verifies **exactly**:
  * *binding* is either the card the process itself runs under — the child's own
    `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` pin, recorded at spawn by `tools/process_registry.py`
    as `kanban_task_id` and already the runtime's own worker→card scope — or a
    cwd
    inside the workspace path the **board row** carries, and only when that
    workspace belongs to exactly one card. The row's rollout/sandbox `task_id`
    is NOT a card and is never read. A card id appearing in the process's
    `command` is **never** a binding — supervisor/reviewer prompts routinely
    name cards they must not touch, and a shared checkout is not ownership of
    every card that ever pointed at it. (On the real board five unfinished cards
    share one workspace directory; that directory binds none of them.)
  * *identity* is decided by the runtime's own PID-reuse guard
    (`ProcessRegistry._host_pid_is_ours`) — exact equality, no tolerance window,
    so the plugin can never verify a `(pid, start)` pair the runtime rejects. A
    row with no recorded start time is liveness-only and is not evidence.
  Its **deadline** (`gtimeout N` in the command, else the configured ceiling) is
  checked, and it only buys silence when something will actually re-enter the
  conversation: a **completion handle** (`notify_on_complete` / watcher) on the
  process, or a verified wake recorded on the card. A live owner with neither is
  a bounded `owner_without_wake` finding, not silence.
* **Live kanban claim** — active run + live pid + fresh heartbeat + unexpired
  claim.
* **Verified wake** — `wake=cron:<job_id>` checked against the real job store
  (exists, enabled, armed, fires before the deadline), `wake=process:<handle>`
  checked against a registry row that is bound to **this** card, identity-
  verified, and carries a completion handle (a process that exists somewhere,
  or one nothing will report on, is not a wake), `wake=dispatcher` checked
  against the card actually being dispatchable. A bare mechanism word
  (`wake=cron`) is **not** a wake.
* **Qualified human gate** — a `STOP-CHECK-GATE:` comment written by a
  configured authority (never by the card's own worker), carrying `until=<ts>`
  or younger than `max_gate_age_seconds`, and not superseded by a later
  `STOP-CHECK-GATE-RESOLVED:`.
* **Typed hold** (`needs_input` / `capability`) — attended while fresh; past
  `max_hold_age_seconds` it becomes `stale_hold` and must be **requalified**.
  Requalification means re-confirming with the human — it is never permission
  to perform the held action.

Three properties are stated, never blurred:

* **Liveness is not progress.** A verified owner proves a process exists. It
  does not prove tool calls, output, or board movement, and the text says so.
* **Unknown is explicit.** No evidence either way (in-flight status with no
  verifiable owner, or an alive pid whose identity will not confirm) is
  `owner_unknown` — a bounded qualification step, never silence and never a
  claim that the card is idle.
* **Requested is not executed.** The gate **dispatches nothing**: no spawn, no
  claim, no board write, no kill, no gate bypass. Every report says so.

A dead owner is never hidden by a future checkpoint someone wrote. A comment —
however recent, however substantive — is never execution proof.

Failed or zero-row board reads are explicit errors, never "no work" — and so is
a configured scope that matches **zero of N** cards, which would otherwise
disable the gate while the config reads as if it were on.

## Honest limitations

* **Enforcement no longer depends on plugin ordering — including after the cap.**
  The bounded continuations run in `pre_verify`, and the *same* directive
  carries a `final_verdict`. The core applies that verdict to the delivered
  answer in `agent/turn_finalizer.py` **after** every `transform_llm_output`
  hook, so what the user receives is fail-explicit even when a transform plugin
  sorting earlier rewrote the answer wholesale, when the model ignored the last
  continuation, or when the iteration budget ran out (`test_34`, both orders,
  asserted on the delivered `final_response` of a real `run_conversation`).
  What a competing transform can still do is replace the *model's own* text —
  it cannot remove the verdict or restore a quiet ending. The verdict is
  applied exactly once and is skipped verbatim-deduplicated when the plugin's
  own fallback already emitted it (`test_35`).
* **The continuation cap is per `(session, board-fingerprint)` per rolling
  `continuation_window_seconds`** — rate-bounded, not one-shot-forever. An
  unchanged board buys at most `max_continuations` per window and each window's
  last grant is terminal (`test_30`); the runtime's own
  `agent.max_verify_nudges` bounds a single turn independently. There is no
  second timer and no unbounded extension.
* **Supervision context expires.** `pre_llm_call` records the turn's user
  message with a TTL (`turn_context_ttl_seconds`, default 900s). Absence already
  failed closed; staleness now does too, so a supervision message from an
  earlier turn cannot gate an unrelated later one (`test_31`).
* The continuation bound is a real cross-process ledger under `$HERMES_HOME`
  (`test_21` proves a separate OS process is denied). It bounds
  **continuations**, not dispatches — there are no dispatches to duplicate.
* **Precision moved in the safe direction.** Ownership requires a structural
  binding, so external workers launched without one (no `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK`
  pin, cwd outside the card's recorded workspace) classify as
  `owner_unknown` — actionable, never quiet (`test_39`, driven through the real
  `terminal` tool). That is deliberate: the previous
  rule attended cards on the strength of a prompt mentioning them.
* **Measured against a frozen read-only copy** of a real board + process
  checkpoint (copy only; the live DB was never opened for write): 13 unfinished
  cards evaluated → 10 unattended findings (`owner_stopped`, `idle_card`,
  `stale_hold`), 3 attended, and all 3 attended for one reason — a qualified
  `human_gate`. No card was attended on cwd alone. Note the report is **capped**
  (`max_findings`, default 5): that run reported 5 and recorded
  `truncated=5`, so a reader must add `truncated` to get the true total.
  On that same snapshot **0 of 2 registry rows carried a `kanban_task_id`
  pin** — today's real external owners are started outside the pinned path, so
  the pin route is a *supported* binding, not one already in use. Until such
  owners are launched with the pin (or inside the card's recorded
  `workspace_path`), they will correctly classify as `owner_unknown`
  rather than attended. This is the known remaining acceptance gap.

## Launching a worker so the gate can see it

The gate reads only what the runtime itself records. Today's `terminal` tool
emits both supported bindings, and **either** is enough:

1. **Kanban pin (preferred).** A worker spawned while `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` names
   the card — every dispatcher-spawned worker already is — has that card
   persisted on its registry row as `kanban_task_id`. Setting the pin grants no
   authority: `tools/kanban_tools.py` uses it to *restrict* a worker to its own
   card (`_enforce_worker_task_ownership`) and still requires dispatcher
   ownership before exposing the lifecycle tools.
2. **The card's own workspace.** `terminal(background=true, workdir=…)` where
   `workdir` is the `workspace_path` the **board row** carries. This needs no
   env at all, but the card's recorded `workspace_path` and the directory the
   worker actually runs in must be the same path.

Supervisor launches that use a `.worktrees/…` directory while the card records
a `~/.hermes/kanban/workspaces/…` path satisfy neither, and are reported as
`owner_unknown`. Two sanctioned ways to fix that — both for the supervisor to
apply, never this plugin:

* launch with `workdir` = the card's recorded `workspace_path`; or
* correct the card's workspace metadata to the directory the worker really
  uses, with the audited operator verb:

  ```bash
  hermes kanban set-workspace <card-id> --kind worktree --path <ABS per-card worktree>
  hermes kanban show <card-id>        # read it back before relying on it
  ```

  `set-workspace` rewrites only `workspace_kind`/`workspace_path`; it moves no
  files, starts no worker, and leaves status, assignee, claim, links and
  history untouched, appending a `workspace_updated` audit event. It refuses a
  running task, an active claim, an unknown kind, a relative or non-existent
  path, and `scratch` + an explicit path. Workers cannot call it
  (`set-workspace` is in `_DELEGATED_CHILD_DENIED_ACTIONS`).

  **Keep the path at the per-card worktree, never the shared repo root** — a
  repo-root path binds any process running anywhere in that checkout, which is
  precisely the mis-assignment this gate must avoid.

  Before this verb there was NO supported mutation surface for these fields:
  `hermes kanban edit` only backfills `result`/`summary`/`metadata` on a done
  task, the dashboard `PATCH /tasks/{id}` body carries no workspace fields, and
  `kanban_db.set_workspace_path` is an internal claim-time write with no kind,
  no audit event and no claim guard.

A model-visible `terminal` parameter for the card id was deliberately **not**
added: it would put a per-plugin field in the core tool schema on every API
call, and the two channels above already carry the binding.

## Configuration

```yaml
agent:
  pre_verify_on_no_edit_turns: true   # core setting; required for no-edit sweeps

agentpod_stop_check:
  enabled: true
  board: agentpod                     # or db_path:
  # project_id / tenant: OMIT unless the board's cards really carry them. A
  # scope matching zero cards is now a hard error (it used to silently sweep
  # nothing); on this board every card has project_id=NULL and tenant=NULL, so
  # the whole board is the correct scope.
  session_ids: ["<supervisor session id>"]
  gate_authorities: ["den"]           # who may record a human gate
  heartbeat_stale_seconds: 900
  max_gate_age_seconds: 259200
  max_hold_age_seconds: 259200
  max_owner_runtime_seconds: 3600
  turn_context_ttl_seconds: 900       # supervision context expiry
  project_aliases: ["agentpod"]       # names that make a progress question supervision
  max_findings: 5
  max_report_chars: 700               # platform budget for the fallback text
  max_continuations: 2
  continuation_window_seconds: 900
```

### Cap ordering (`max_verify_nudges` vs `max_continuations`)

The `pre_verify` call site only re-evaluates while
`attempt < agent.max_verify_nudges`. If the **core** cap is reached first
(`agent.max_verify_nudges <= agentpod_stop_check.max_continuations`) the verdict
recorded at the first evaluation is frozen and ships **even when the
continuation then really resolved the board** — a stale fail-explicit verdict on
finished work.

The shipped defaults are safe: `max_verify_nudges: 3` (core default) vs
`max_continuations: 2`, so the plugin's own cap is hit first and the last
evaluation clears the verdict. Rather than changing runtime behavior, the
activation preflight **refuses** the inverted ordering and names the exact
required setting (`agent.max_verify_nudges` >= `max_continuations + 1`).
Covered by `test_40_preflight_refuses_a_stale_verdict_cap_ordering`.

## Activation (staged, reversible, core first)

The plugin is useless — and silently so — against an installed core that lacks
`agent.pre_verify_on_no_edit_turns`: `pre_verify` never fires on a no-edit
turn, only the preemptable fallback survives, and the config reads as if the
gate were on. `activation_preflight.py` exists so that cannot happen unnoticed.
It is read-only: it writes nothing, installs nothing and restarts nothing.

```bash
# 0. BEFORE any installation: independent review of this branch.
# 1. Land the CORE half into the installed checkout through the sanctioned
#    fork mechanism (no self-approve, no self-restart, no disguised external
#    cron restart), then read it back independently.
python contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/activation_preflight.py \
    --core-root ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
# -> REFUSES while the installed core predates the change. Reversal: no-op.

# 2. Stage the plugin INERT: copy it to ~/.hermes/plugins/ with
#    `enabled: false` and `agent.pre_verify_on_no_edit_turns` still false.
#    Confirm no hook fires. Reversal: delete the directory.

# 3. Scope it, still off, then re-run the preflight against the real config:
python contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/activation_preflight.py \
    --core-root ~/.hermes/hermes-agent \
    --config ~/.hermes/config.yaml --board-db ~/.hermes/kanban/<board>.db
# -> REFUSES an empty session scope or a project/tenant scope matching 0 cards.

# 4. Only on exit 0, flip `enabled: true` and
#    `agent.pre_verify_on_no_edit_turns: true` as one separately authorised
#    change. Reversal: set both back to false.
# 5. Restart is a separate, human-authorised step.
```

Nothing in this branch performs any of those steps.

Scope: only the listed session, only the configured board/project. Other
projects, profiles, boards and sessions are never read. A same-session user
stop/topic change ("stop the board sweep, forget it for now") wins immediately;
an unrelated question is untouched no matter how its answer is phrased.

## Which messages are supervision (intent, not keyword occurrence)

The trigger is the turn's **user message**, classified by intent:

* A **stop directive** silences the gate immediately, exactly as before
  ("stop the board sweep, forget it for now", "pause the sweep", "not now",
  "stop — forget the board, what's the weather?").
* A stop *token* that is **not** a directive no longer silences it. Three
  cases, all previously misclassified and all now regression-tested
  (`test_41`–`test_45`):
  * **negated** — "Do **not** stop supervising the board", "never stop the
    sweep";
  * **quoted / historical** — `you said "stop working on the board" last week`
    (quoted spans are excluded; an intra-word apostrophe is not a quote);
  * **not in imperative position** — the token has its own grammatical subject,
    so it reports on the system rather than commanding the agent
    ("tenants **stop working** after an LXD restart"). A multi-part request
    that contains such a clause is still supervision.
* A **status/progress question naming the project** is supervision even with no
  board vocabulary ("What is progress on AgentPod?"). The project name is
  required for this route, so "any update on my flight?" stays untouched.
  Aliases come from `agentpod_stop_check.project_aliases` (default
  `["agentpod"]`) plus `board` / `project_id` / `tenant` when configured.

A stop is recognised through its preamble, a bullet or number, a colon, an
emoji, leading whitespace or a smart apostrophe (`test_46`, `test_47`), and a
quoted span the user explicitly **adopts** (`Please do exactly this: "stop
supervising the board"`) is the command, not history (`test_46`). Quoting is
not automatically historical; the frame that introduces the quote decides.

There is **no universal fail-open**, and none is claimed. Each stop token gets
one of three verdicts: *command* (silences the gate), *reported* — negated,
cited, or carrying its own subject/subordinator ("tenants **stop working**
after an LXD restart", "you are missing details **and stop working**", which is
the user describing the agent's failure and is still supervision), and
*undecided* — a live stop token in a shape the clause analysis cannot place
("As discussed stop the board sweep"). An **undecided token keeps the gate
quiet**: the doubt is spent on the user, never on the supervision. It is not
reported as a directive, so `stop_directive()` stays an honest
*clearly-commanded* answer. The undecided class is a real, acknowledged
residual, not a solved case.

Session scope, the opt-in enable flag and the bounded continuation budget are
unchanged — the wider positive routes widen intent recognition, never scope
(`test_45`).

## Tests

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/test_stop_check.py -q
scripts/run_tests.sh tests/run_agent/test_pre_verify_no_edit_turns.py tests/agent/test_verify_hooks.py -q
```

65 tests (46 functions): the 10 acceptance scenarios, the first independent review's
adversarial findings as invariants (`test_11`–`test_23`), the re-review's
R1–R8 as invariants (`test_24`–`test_33`), and this round's two acceptance
blockers (`test_34`–`test_39`): the delivered post-cap answer under both
plugin orders with a hostile transform and a 20 000-char quiet draft, verdict
de-duplication and budget, user stop / interrupt / topic-change precedence,
default-off inertness for every other plugin, and the real `terminal`
background launch whose registry row binds a real process to a real card (and
the unpinned launch that binds nothing). `test_33` drives a real
`AIAgent.run_conversation` whose post-continuation tool call is dispatched
through the **unpatched** `handle_function_call` into the real `terminal` tool;
`test_27` is a controlled start-time fixture. Test 10 is a mutation
control. `test_41`-`test_45` are the message-intent repair: the classifier
contract, the five supervision shapes driven through the real `pre_llm_call`
dispatch + `pre_verify` aggregator + turn finalizer on an isolated board, a
compacted-context turn whose current intent must survive the compaction
summary, six genuine stop shapes that must still win, and session scope.
`test_46`-`test_50` are the second independent review's findings as
invariants: the repaired stop shapes and adopted-vs-cited quotes in the
classifier (`test_46`), the reviewer's six-case probe through the real hook
chain (`test_47`), the real user complaint that must stay supervised work
(`test_48`), the project-name intent route driven through a real
`AIAgent.run_conversation` into the unpatched `terminal` tool (`test_49`), and
the resumed/compacted turn that arrives with an EMPTY user message and must
fail closed (`test_50`). Note the scope of each claim: `test_42`/`test_44`
drive the real **hooks** (aggregator + finalizer), while `test_33`/`test_49`
are the ones that drive the real **loop**. Red-green and the three guard mutations: see the receipt.

## Review round 1 (PR #4 @ 7dd95746cc) — the two blockers

**Blocker 1 — suite green only outside a dispatched worker.** `test_34` asserts
a raw model-call count (`len(calls) == 2`). Under the real deployment context
(`HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` set, as it is for every dispatched kanban worker),
`agent/conversation_loop.py` fires its kanban no-complete finalizer
("kanban stop-loop nudge issued") and injects two extra api calls, so the
count is 4 and the test fails. The variable has nothing to do with this
plugin: a supervision session is not a dispatched kanban worker. Fixed in the
`home` fixture, which now deletes `HERMES_KANBAN_TASK` alongside
`HERMES_KANBAN_DB`/`HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD`; `test_38`, which genuinely wants the
worker context, still sets it back explicitly. Verified both ways:

    HERMES_KANBAN_TASK=t_8c480dce pytest .../test_stop_check.py -q -p no:randomly
      -> 65 passed                                        (was 1 failed, 64 passed)
    env -u HERMES_KANBAN_TASK pytest ... -> 65 passed

**Blocker 2 — carved out, NOT dropped.** The unblock asked for a runtime
integration test proving the unblock/review/request-changes transition cannot
leave a non-current worker alive or admit a duplicate writer. That enforcement
does not belong in this plugin and cannot be implemented here: the plugin is an
opt-in, session-scoped `transform_llm_output`/`pre_verify` observer of ONE
supervision session; it has no dispatcher authority, and the defect happens in
core with no supervision turn in flight.

Line-level account of the real defect:

* `hermes_cli/kanban_db.py:request_changes` sets `worker_pid = NULL` on the
  task row and ends the run, but never calls `_terminate_reclaimed_worker`
  — unlike `release_stale_claims` (`kanban_db.py:5042`) and
  `reclaim_task` (`:5142`), which both terminate before releasing, and unlike
  the ancestor-reopen path, which collects `terminations` and drains them
  post-commit. `request_review` (`:6607`) has the same NULL-out-without-
  terminate shape.
* Consequence: the row loses the only handle to the live process while the
  process keeps running in the card's workspace, and the task lands back in
  `ready`, so the next dispatcher tick claims it and spawns a second writer
  into the same directory. That is exactly the observed `t_f7fad689`
  regression (run 2007 `changes_requested` at 1789657120, run 2008 claimed at
  1789657130, same `workspace_path`).

Reproduced on an isolated temporary board with a process the script owns:

    python contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/repro_handoff_duplicate_writer.py
    previous worker pid 67759 alive after handoff: True
    task row worker_pid after handoff: None
    task status after handoff:          ready
    next claim succeeded immediately:   True
    same workspace for both writers:    True
    RESULT: DUPLICATE WRITER REPRODUCED          (exit 0)

The fix is a core change to `hermes_cli/kanban_db.py` (terminate-then-release
in the review transitions, mirroring the reclaim paths) plus its own tests
under `tests/`; it is carved out as a separate card rather than smuggled into
this opt-in plugin.

## Review round 2 (PR #4 @ 94f68a8144) — CI and the two new criteria

**Blocker 1 — CI red on the PR head.** `Python lints / ruff enforcement` failed
on `unspecified-encoding` at `contrib/den-plugins/kanban-wake/__init__.py:54`
(`open(p).read()`), a file inside this PR's stack, not upstream. Fixed by
passing `encoding="utf-8"`; `uvx ruff check .` -> `All checks passed!`.
`check-attribution` failed because the fork's commit author emails
(`engineer@gray-knight-m1.local`, `guard@localhost`) had no mapping file; both
are now mapped to `dzianisv` under `contributors/emails/` via
`scripts/add_contributor.py` (the sanctioned path — `AUTHOR_MAP` in
`release.py` is frozen).

**Blocker 2 — the two lifecycle criteria added mid-round.** Both are core
`hermes_cli/kanban_db.py` defects, same class as the round-1 carve-out and for
the same reason: this plugin is a session-scoped observer with no dispatcher
authority.

* (a) `schedule_task` (`kanban_db.py:8060`) matches
  `status IN ('todo','ready','running','blocked')` — `review`/`triage` are
  absent, so parking a review-phase card returns False, the card stays in
  `review`, and the dispatcher's review lane (`~:10863` ->
  `claim_review_task` `:4739`) re-claims it and spawns duplicate review over
  unchanged work.
* (b) A card legitimately waiting twice on the same known external gate hits
  `BLOCK_RECURRENCE_LIMIT` (`:134`, routing at `:6365`) and is routed to
  `triage`: the real wake is lost and a human is pulled into a wait that was
  never ambiguous. The loop-breaker itself is correct and must not be weakened;
  what is missing is a status/path that carries the wake.

Reproduced on an isolated temporary board, no real card touched:

    python contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/repro_review_park_unsupported.py
    (a) schedule_task(review) returned:       False
    (a) status after park attempt:            review
    (a) review re-claimed (respawn):          True
    (b) status after 2nd identical wait:      triage
    (b) BLOCK_RECURRENCE_LIMIT:               2
    RESULT (a) REPRODUCED / RESULT (b) REPRODUCED        (exit 0)

Carved onto card `t_76bca50a` (`parents=[t_8c480dce]`) with the acceptance
criteria, alongside the round-1 carve-out `t_f0b49db9`. Not implemented here.

## Escalation classification (EM regression, t_de12518a / PR #4952)

**Defect.** A supervision turn escalated to the human although (a) a documented,
authorised **opaque** non-author review identity existed, (b) an independent
artifact review had been done at a pinned SHA, and (c) only a formal review gate
remained. Nothing in that state is irreversible, financial, or external-policy —
the correct action was to route the scoped review. Escalating burned a human
round trip.

**Fix.** `escalation.py` classifies a `STOP-CHECK-ESCALATION:` marker into one of
four decisions, and `stopcheck._classify` step 3b acts on it *before* the
human-gate branch (so a routable escalation can never be laundered into
"attended by a human gate" and left quiet):

| decision | finding kind | when |
|---|---|---|
| `route_scoped_review` | `escalation_routable` | `class=review_gate`, documented opaque capability, `review_sha` == current head |
| `require_fresh_review` | `escalation_stale_review` | head moved, or head unobservable — the pinned review is stale, capability must NOT be used |
| `access_blocker` | `escalation_access_blocker` | no documented identity, it does not positively declare `opaque: true`, or it would reveal or mint a credential |
| `human_required` | *(unchanged)* | any other class, or no class at all |

Fail-closed by construction: only `class=review_gate` is routable, an undeclared
capability refuses rather than assumes, opacity must be **positively asserted**
(`opaque: true`; unstated or the bare-string shorthand is never routable), and an
unknown head never matches a pinned review. Head resolution prefers a live resolver / operator observation
over the marker's own `head_sha` — the marker is precisely the thing that goes
stale.

**Config** (`agentpod_stop_check`):

```yaml
review_capabilities:
  - name: app-review
    opaque: true              # REQUIRED to route; false or unstated => blocked
    reveals_credential: false # true  => blocked
# The shorthand form `- app-review` is accepted but never routable: it cannot
# declare opacity, so it always yields an access blocker.
current_heads: {"*": "<sha>"}  # or head_resolver: callable(task) -> sha

**Proof.** `test_51`–`test_55` in `test_stop_check.py` drive the real runtime
path (`pre_llm_call` → `pre_verify` → `finalize_turn`), not wording. Mutation
receipt:

```
# delete the step-3b dispatch from stopcheck._classify (763 chars)
$ scripts/run_tests.sh contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/test_stop_check.py \
    -k "test_51 or test_52 or test_53 or test_55"
=== Summary: 1 files, 0 tests passed, 4 failed ===       # RED
$ git checkout -- contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/stopcheck.py
$ scripts/run_tests.sh contrib/den-plugins/agentpod-stop-check/test_stop_check.py
=== Summary: 1 files, 70 tests passed, 0 failed ===       # GREEN
```

`install_runtime()` now derives the installed module set by globbing
`*.py` instead of a hand-maintained tuple — the previous literal list would have
silently omitted `escalation.py` from the installed plugin while the suite
stayed green against the source tree (P-GUARD).
