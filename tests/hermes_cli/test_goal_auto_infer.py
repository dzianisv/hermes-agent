"""goals.auto_infer — a goal-less session whose reply commits to work gets an inferred goal.

Covers: judge parsing (true/false/garbage/short objective), fail-open on API error, the
``source="auto"`` tag surviving a JSON round trip + status line, never overwriting a user goal,
the config gate, and the gateway's user-authored-turn filter (heartbeat / continuation / internal
events must not seed goals)."""
