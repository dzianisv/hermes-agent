# Proof harness for the disk-guard "top reclaimable" ranking.
#
# CLASS proven: the alert of 2026-09-21T02:01 listed six /private/tmp files of
# ONE du block each (wake.out = 30 bytes, hb.bak = 18KB) as the top reclaimable
# paths. The scan covered the wrong roots (kanban workspaces + /private/tmp only)
# and ranked by du blocks, so an operator following it would delete nothing.
# An alert whose remediation list is noise is worse than no alert.
#
# Requirements encoded here:
#   R1 entries are ordered bytes-descending
#   R2 sub-100MB trivia never appears
#   R3 the real scratch roots (worktrees, pnpm store, hermes logs/sessions) are
#      covered — proven by planting a large dir under a real root and requiring
#      it to surface
#   R4 a path with a LIVE process in it is never listed as reclaimable
#   R5 a path the guard's OWN reclaim classes are forbidden to delete is never
#      listed. CLASS (measured 2026-10-05, card t_4b6e5ab2): the RED page named
#      ~/.cache/huggingface (guard_hf_cache protects it) and
#      ~/Library/pnpm/store/v10 (reclaim_stale_pnpm_stores logged
#      "skip (referenced)" every tick). An operator following the list deleted
#      both: local STT model gone, three projects forced to reinstall. A
#      remediation list that recommends what the automation refuses to do is
#      worse than no list.
