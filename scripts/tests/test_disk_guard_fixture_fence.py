"""The fixture fence: a FAKE free-space figure must never reach a real channel.

CLASS under test — measured on this host, 2026-09-25:

  sqlite3 ~/.hermes/kanban.db \
    "select id,datetime(created_at,'unixepoch','localtime') from tasks
     where created_by='disk-guard';"
      t_849189ed | 2026-09-25 19:04:47
      t_0fbf5b8d | 2026-09-25 19:04:49

Both cards say "8.0Gi free (floor 10.0Gi)". At 19:04 the host really had 23Gi
free and the pinned production floor is 0.5Gi, so NEITHER number is a
measurement of this host — 8/10 are the literals
tests/test_disk_guard_incident_key.py feeds to dga.main(). The bytecode
mtime of that test file is the same second (19:04:43). One test there
(test_suppressed_tick_does_not_extend_the_ttl) patches deliver_wake and
deliver_telegram but NOT deliver_kanban_cto — the route that has been live
since 2026-09-24 — so the unpatched channel ran for real and manufactured two
CTO incidents out of a unit test.

Cost of the class: a synthetic page consumes a human's attention and a worker
slot, and it spends the credibility of the one channel that must be believed
during a real ENOSPC. A guard that cries wolf is the same defect as a guard
that stays silent.

The fence is derived, not enumerated: any call that would page while
DISK_GUARD_FAKE_FREE_GI is set is refused, so a channel added tomorrow is
covered without anyone remembering to list it here, and a test that forgets to
patch a channel fails loudly instead of paging production.

Run: python3 -m pytest ~/.hermes/scripts/tests/test_disk_guard_fixture_fence.py -q
