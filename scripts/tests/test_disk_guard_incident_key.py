"""Invariant tests for disk_guard_alert.incident_key.

CLASS under test — measured on 2026-09-21: the disk guard paged 17 times in one
day (last six at 07:58 08:13 08:29 08:46 09:03 09:19, every ~16 min) for ONE
unchanging state: 8Gi free, floor 10Gi, no owned reclaim. The 6h dedupe was
armed and never engaged, because incident_key() hashed the RENDERED detail text
and that text is not a function of the state. Two renderings alternated:

  (a) "No single reclaimable path over 100MB — ... Check state.db / postgres /
       purgeable."
  (b) "  1746MB  .../pnpm/store/v10\n  443MB  .../.copilot/session-state/<uuid>"

Reproduced cause (not the one originally assumed): (a) is NOT "everything is
under the 100MB threshold". Both paths are far over it on every tick. (a) is
produced when disk-guard.sh's lsof-based `path_in_use` filter transiently drops
those directories because some unrelated process holds a descriptor on them —
verified by opening fds on both dirs and watching `--top-reclaimable` return
empty. Absence of a ranking is absence of EVIDENCE, not evidence of change.

The bodies below are the verbatim renderings recorded in
~/.hermes/logs/disk-guard.log on 2026-09-21.
