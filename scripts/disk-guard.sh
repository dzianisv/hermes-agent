#!/usr/bin/env bash
# disk-guard.sh — fail loudly below a free-space floor, and reclaim space from
# agent scratch that is provably dead (terminal kanban tasks, merged worktrees,
# stale /private/tmp clones).
#
# CLASS this fixes: an ENOSPC host makes every watchdog unreliable while it
# still reports green. Each concurrent agent worker materialises a du-apparent
# clone (kanban scratch workspace, /private/tmp clone, or git worktree) and
# nothing reaps them when the task ends.
#
# Everything checked here is DERIVED from the source of truth at runtime:
#   - live/dead task set  -> sqlite query against ~/.hermes/kanban.db
#   - merged branches     -> git merge-base --is-ancestor against origin/main
#   - in-use directories  -> running process table
# There is no hand-maintained list of paths to keep in sync.
#
# Usage:
#   disk-guard.sh            # check only; exit 1 if below floor
#   disk-guard.sh --reclaim  # check, reclaim dead scratch, re-check
#
# Exit codes: 0 = at or above floor, 1 = below floor after reclaim.

# TWO NUMBERS, TWO JOBS. Conflating them is what produced both failure modes
# this guard has actually shown: a 10Gi floor paged 67 times in 13h with no
# failed write (alert fatigue), and a 0.5Gi floor let the host cross from
# healthy to ENOSPC inside one 900s tick (no warning at all).
#
#   RECLAIM_TARGET_GI  how much free space we try to HOLD. Enforced by evicting
#                      more sanctioned scratch, SILENTLY. Never pages.
#   FLOOR_GI           the only thing that pages. Owner-pinned at 0.5Gi
#                      (Den, 2026-09-22) — page only where writes actually fail.
#
# The target was 10Gi (the capacity derivation in disk-guard-cron.sh: 2.0GB
# worst case for 3 concurrent workers on a cold pnpm store + 8GB headroom for
# the non-worker writers on this volume — state.db, postgres, gateway logs).
# RAISED TO 25Gi on 2026-09-25 (card t_2a74e97a, review round 1): the card
# contracts >=25GB free, and a target of 10 never fires at 23Gi, so nothing
# defended the contracted number — free space hit 25.17Gi once and decayed
# straight back to 23.1Gi. The target is what holds a number; a one-shot sweep
# is not. 25Gi (26.8GB) also clears the 25GB decimal contract with margin.
# Raising it is safe by construction: the target only evicts sanctioned scratch
# and is SILENT — it can never page, so a high target cannot cause alert fatigue.

# argv ("sleep 900") that never mentions the path.
path_in_use() { # $1 = abs path
  # SELF-MATCH BUG (found 2026-09-25): this used
  #   ps -Ao args= | grep -Fq -- "$1"
  # and `grep`'s OWN argv contains "$1", so ps listed it and the grep matched
  # itself. path_in_use therefore returned "in use" for EVERY path ever passed:
  # every reclaim class that consults it deleted nothing, and top_reclaimable
  # filtered out every candidate — which is exactly the "No single reclaimable
  # path over 100MB" line the operator kept reading on a host that was filling
  # up. Passing the needle through the ENVIRONMENT keeps it out of argv, so the
  # scan can no longer see itself.
  # (Exported, not a command-prefix assignment: a prefix binds only to the
  # first command of the pipeline -- `ps` -- and awk would see an empty needle,
  # matching every line and reinstating the same always-in-use bug.)
  # SYMLINKED-PREFIX BUG (found 2026-09-25): the caller's path and the live
  # process's argv routinely spell the SAME file differently. On macOS $TMPDIR
  # is /var/folders/... while /var is a symlink to /private/var, and `git

# provisions its OWN 1.8GB Chromium under $TMPDIR/pytest-of-<user>/pytest-N;
# pytest's own retention keeps the last 3 numbered roots and never accounts for

# checkout, so the node_modules sweep did not either.

# Liveness, not age, is the predicate: these roots are minutes old by
# construction, so an age rule either deletes a running test's fixture or never
# fires. Keep `pytest-current` (the symlink target of the run in progress) and
# anything a live process holds open; evict the rest.
